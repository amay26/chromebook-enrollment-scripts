Chromebook Enrolment Arduino Pro Micro Scripts

## Usage

Super simple. What you'll need for this is a Pro Micro and a button attached on pin 10 (although that's changable).

Plug it into your device and watch the magic.

## Installation onto Arduino

- Grab the script for your chrome version (currently it's chrome-58-and-up-enrollment.ino |[raw to copy and paste](https://github.com/iamtheyammer/chromebook-enrollment-scripts/raw/master/chrome-58-and-up.ino)|[view](https://github.com/iamtheyammer/chromebook-enrollment-scripts/blob/master/chrome-58-and-up.ino))
- Change the settings as instructed at the top of the script
- Upload to your Arduino device

## Credits
[AmplifiedIT](https://labs.amplifiedit.com/centipede/) wrote the script for Chrome version 58-69, and I modified it to work with Chrome version 70 and up. I use this every day and needed a version for the new chrome version.

Under the MIT license just like theirs.
